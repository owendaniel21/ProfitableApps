    "We can see something simlar in the Reference, Social Networking, Music, and Weather apps.

    "   2. Health & Fitness - There is an emerging market with at-home workouts and subsriction based workouts that could be an opportunity. There are competitors, but none that have gained major momentum with customers and there is room for innovation and growth in this genre. \n",
    "   3. Travel - There is lots of competition in the Travel genre, but there may be opportunity as the market changes post Covid-19. This is a genre to keep an eye on as the market shifts and customers become reinvigorated. \n",
    "   4. Finance - Thre is a growing popularity of Fintech and demand for a convenient way to store, send and invest funds. This would require knowledge of complex financial systems that may not be readily available to us.\n",

This would aid users to learn the language of a place that they might be visiting or simply help them communiate through the audio. It would also allow users to look into historical sources to find out about the culture and historical sites of a place they are planning to go to. \n",

These are what we are trying to target in our app development as they show the most potential in terms of current popularity and how realistic it would be to compete in the market. The obvious app to develop for these categories would be one having to do e-books, but there seem to be so many apps attempting to do this.\n",

    "Looking at some of the other genres in the Apple Store data set, I noticed that travel was one that was pretty popular. It is also quite popular in the Google PlWhile there is lots of competition in the Travel genre, there may be opportunity as the market changes post Covid-19 and most current apps are focused on planning travel and not dealing with a new place or give you insight into the places to visit.\n",
